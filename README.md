To help maintainers,
we use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) test build the lesson
and verify some things.
If your pull request make the build fail,
maintainers will ask you to fix it before accept your contribution.

## The importance of keeping your branch up-to-date

### Demonstration of the merge-conflict

If you edit a file that has already been updated upstream,
a merge conflict can arise.

### How to bring your fork up-to-date?

You need to create a pull request from the upstream repository into your own fork.

## Questions and Answers

1. **How can I see my changes in the HTML?**
